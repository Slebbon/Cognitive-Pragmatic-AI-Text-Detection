# Cognitive-Pragmatic-AI-Text-Detection
This repository contains the full experimental pipeline developed for a master’s thesis on AI-generated text detection. It implements a cognitively and pragmatically grounded feature extraction framework, integrates multiple feature families with stylometric baselines, and evaluates their contribution using interpretable machine learning models.
